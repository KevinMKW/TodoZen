## Project Goals
- **Define the TodoList Component**: This project kicks off by creating a functional component that defines the TodoList component.

- **Manage State with useState Hook**: Leveraging the power of the useState hook, the app efficiently manages the state in the TodoList component.

- **Design the User Interface with JSX**: By using JSX, the app creates an engaging and stylish user interface for the TodoList component.

- **Handle Events**: The app implements event handling to add and delete todo items, including form submissions and button clicks.

- **Conditional Rendering**: Using conditional rendering, the app selectively displays the delete button for a todo item only if it exists, enhancing user-friendliness and efficiency.
